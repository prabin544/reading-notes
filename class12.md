## Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
- SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational.
- SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
- SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
- SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.
- SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, NoSQL are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?  
- If our data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined, conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.  
### Give a real world example.
- For instance, if we are developing a point of sale system where we need to store customer orders and product records.   
### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
- If the project is expected to see drastic changes, needs to handle the huge and versatile amount of data, or the database entities and scheme is ambiguous at the start, NoSQL would be a good fit.   
### Give a real world example.  
- You are constantly adding new features, functions, data types, and itâ€™s difficult to predict how the application will grow over time.  
### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- MongoDB  
### Which type of database is best for scalability?
- MySQL or PostgreSQL

#### What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.  

#### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? 
It has a great impact on people, how they perceive. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home which was clearly wrong.  

#### What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?  
- Companies are losing out on great talent 
- Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base   
- It’s the right thing to do   

#### When are diversity efforts most successful?   
Diversity efforts are most successful because studies proved that diversed team are more creative and innovative. Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.  

#### Why do diverse companies perform better?  
Diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones. By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is at the table.   

#### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.  
A vice-versa example would be YouTube’s which almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.

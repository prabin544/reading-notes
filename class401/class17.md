## Web Scraping
Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort. In this article, we will go through an easy example of how to automate downloading hundreds of files from the New York MTA. This is a great exercise for web scraping beginners who are looking to understand how to web scrape.   

### Libraries that can be used for web scraping 
- requests
- bs4
- selenium

#### Sample
```
# Import libraries
import requests
import urllib.request
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Set the URL you want to webscrape from
url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'

# Connect to the URL
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse HTML and save to BeautifulSoup objectÂ¶
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

# To download the whole data set, let's do a for loop through all a tags
line_count = 1 #variable to track what line you are on
for one_a_tag in soup.findAll('a'):  #'a' tags are for links
    if line_count >= 36: #code for text files starts at line 36
        link = one_a_tag['href']
        download_url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/'+ link
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url,'./'+link[link.find('/turnstile_')+1:]) 
        time.sleep(1) #pause the code for a sec
    #add 1 for next line
    line_count +=1
```

### How to scrape websites without getting blocked
- Respect Robots.txt
- Make the crawling slower, do not slam the server, treat websites nicely
- Do not follow the same crawling pattern
- Make requests through Proxies and rotate them as needed
- Rotate User Agents and corresponding HTTP Request Headers between requests
- Use a headless browser like Puppeteer, Selenium or Playwright
- Beware of Honey Pot Traps
- Check if Website is Changing Layouts
- Avoid scraping data behind a login
- Use Captcha Solving Services

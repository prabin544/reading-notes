## Python Regular Expression

### Regular Expressions in Python
In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. That means that if you want to start using them in your Python scripts, you have to import this module with the help of import:
```
import re
```
The re library in Python provides several functions that make it a skill worth mastering. You will see some of them closely in this tutorial.


### Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters
You can easily tackle many basic patterns in Python using ordinary characters. Ordinary characters are the simplest regular expressions. They match themselves exactly and do not have a special meaning in their regular expression syntax.

Examples are 'A', 'a', 'X', '5'.

Ordinary characters can be used to perform simple exact matches:
```
pattern = r"Cookie"
sequence = "Cookie"
if re.match(pattern, sequence):
    print("Match!")
else: print("Not a match!")
```
```
Match!
```
Most alphabets and characters will match themselves, as you saw in the example.

The match() function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None. The re module also contains several other functions, and you will learn some of them later on in the tutorial.

For now, let's focus on ordinary characters!

Do you notice the r at the start of the pattern Cookie?
This is called a raw string literal. It changes how the string literal is interpreted. Such literals are stored as they appear.

For example, \ is just a backslash when prefixed with an r rather than being interpreted as an escape sequence. You will see what this means with special characters. Sometimes, the syntax involves backslash-escaped characters, and to prevent these characters from being interpreted as escape sequences; you use the raw r prefix.

TIP: You don't actually need it for this example; however, it is a good practice to use it for consistency.


### Wild Card Characters: Special Characters
Special characters are characters that do not match themselves as seen but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression. For simple understanding, they can be thought of as reserved metacharacters that denote something else and not what they look like.

Let's check out some examples to see the special characters in action...

But before you do, the examples below make use of two functions namely: search() and group().
With the search function, you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match.
The group function returns the string matched by the re. You will see both these functions in more detail later.

Back to the special characters now.

. - A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.
```
re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()
```
```
'Cookie'
```
^ - A caret. Matches the start of the string.

This is helpful if you want to make sure a document/sentence starts with certain characters.
```
re.search(r'^Eat', "Eat cake!").group()

## However, the code below will not give the same result. Try it for yourself:
# re.search(r'^eat', "Let's eat cake!").group()
```
```
'Eat'
```
$ - Matches the end of string.

This is helpful if you want to make sure a document/sentence ends with certain characters.
```
re.search(r'cake$', "Cake! Let's eat cake").group()

## The next search will return the NONE value, try it:
# re.search(r'cake$', "Let's get some cake on our way home!").group()
```
```
'cake'
```
[abc] - Matches a or b or c.
[a-zA-Z0-9] - Matches any letter from (a to z) or (A to Z) or (0 to 9).

TIP: Characters that are not within a range can be matched by complementing the set. If the first character of the set is ^, all the characters that are not in the set will be matched.
```
re.search(r'[0-6]', 'Number: 5').group()
```
```
'5'
```
```
## Matches any character except 5
re.search(r'Number: [^5]', 'Number: 0').group()

## This will not match and hence a NONE value will be returned
#re.search(r'Number: [^5]', 'Number: 5').group()
```
```
'Number: 0'
```
\ - Backslash.
Perhaps, the most diverse metacharacter!!

If the character following the backslash is a recognized escape character, then the special meaning of the term is taken (Scenario 1)
Else if the character following the \ is not a recognized escape character, then the \ is treated like any other character and passed through (Scenario 2).
\ can be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove their special meaning (Scenario 3).
```
## (Scenario 1) This treats '\s' as an escape character, '\s' defines a space
re.search(r'Not a\sregular character', 'Not a regular character').group()
```
```
'Not a regular character'
```
```
## (Scenario 2) '\' is treated as an ordinary character, because '\r' is not a recognized escape character
re.search(r'Just a \regular character', 'Just a \regular character').group()
```
```
'Just a \regular character'
```
```
## (Scenario 3) '\s' is escaped using an extra `\` so its interpreted as a literal string '\s'
re.search(r'Just a \\sregular character', 'Just a \sregular character').group()
```
```
'Just a \\sregular character'
```
There is a predefined set of special sequences that begin with '\' and are also very helpful when performing search and match. Let's look at some of them up close...

\w - Lowercase 'w'. Matches any single letter, digit, or underscore.
\W - Uppercase 'W'. Matches any character not part of \w (lowercase w).
```
print("Lowercase w:", re.search(r'Co\wk\we', 'Cookie').group())

## Matches any character except single letter, digit or underscore
print("Uppercase W:", re.search(r'C\Wke', 'C@ke').group())

## Uppercase W won't match single letter, digit
print("Uppercase W won't match, and return:", re.search(r'Co\Wk\We', 'Cookie'))
```
```
Lowercase w: Cookie
Uppercase W: C@ke
Uppercase W won't match, and return: None
```
\s - Lowercase 's'. Matches a single whitespace character like: space, newline, tab, return.
\S - Uppercase 'S'. Matches any character not part of \s (lowercase s).
```
print("Lowercase s:", re.search(r'Eat\scake', 'Eat cake').group())
print("Uppercase S:", re.search(r'cook\Se', "Let's eat cookie").group())
```
```
Lowercase s: Eat cake
Uppercase S: cookie
```
\d - Lowercase d. Matches decimal digit 0-9.
\D - Uppercase d. Matches any character that is not a decimal digit.
```
# Example for \d
print("How many cookies do you want? ", re.search(r'\d+', '100 cookies').group())
```
```
How many cookies do you want?  100
```
The + symbol used after the \d in the example above is used for repetition. You will see this in some more detail in the repetition section later on...

\t - Lowercase t. Matches tab.
\n - Lowercase n. Matches newline.
\r - Lowercase r. Matches return.
\A - Uppercase a. Matches only at the start of the string. Works across multiple lines as well.
\Z - Uppercase z. Matches only at the end of the string.
TIP: ^ and \A are effectively the same, and so are $ and \Z. Except when dealing with MULTILINE mode. Learn more about it in the flags section.

\b - Lowercase b. Matches only the beginning or end of the word.
```
# Example for \t
print("\\t (TAB) example: ", re.search(r'Eat\tcake', 'Eat    cake').group())

# Example for \b
print("\\b match gives: ",re.search(r'\b[A-E]ookie', 'Cookie').group())
```
```
\t (TAB) example:  Eat    cake
\b match gives:  Cookie
```
### Repetitions
It becomes quite tedious if you are looking to find long patterns in a sequence. Fortunately, the re module handles repetitions using the following special characters:

+ - Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times starting from that position.
```
re.search(r'Co+kie', 'Cooookie').group()
```
```
'Cooookie'
```
* - Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times starting from that position.
```
# Checks for any occurrence of a or o or both in the given sequence
re.search(r'Ca*o*kie', 'Cookie').group()
```
```
'Cookie'
```
? - Checks if the preceding character appears exactly zero or one time starting from that position.
```
# Checks for exactly zero or one occurrence of a or o or both in the given sequence
re.search(r'Colou?r', 'Color').group()
```
```
'Color'
```
But what if you want to check for an exact number of sequence repetition?

For example, checking the validity of a phone number in an application. re module handles this very gracefully as well using the following regular expressions:

{x} - Repeat exactly x number of times.
{x,} - Repeat at least x times or more.
{x, y} - Repeat at least x times but no more than y times.
```
re.search(r'\d{9,10}', '0987654321').group()
```
```
'0987654321'
```
The + and * qualifiers are said to be greedy. You will see what this means later on.


### Grouping in Regular Expressions
The group feature of regular expression allows you to pick up parts of the matching text. Parts of a regular expression pattern bounded by parenthesis () are called groups. The parenthesis does not change what the expression matches, but rather forms groups within the matched sequence. You have been using the group() function all along in this tutorial's examples. The plain match.group() without any argument is still the whole matched text as usual.

Let's understand this concept with a simple example. Imagine you were validating email addresses and wanted to check the user name and host. This is when you would want to create separate groups within your matched text.
```
statement = 'Please contact us at: support@datacamp.com'
match = re.search(r'([\w\.-]+)@([\w\.-]+)', statement)
if statement:
  print("Email address:", match.group()) # The whole matched text
  print("Username:", match.group(1)) # The username (group 1)
  print("Host:", match.group(2)) # The host (group 2)
```
```
Email address: support@datacamp.com
Username: support
Host: datacamp.com
```
Another way of doing the same is with the usage of <> brackets instead. This will let you create named groups. Named groups will make your code more readable. The syntax for creating named group is: (?P<name>...). Replace the name part with the name you want to give to your group. The ... represent the rest of the matching syntax. See this in action using the same example as before...
```
statement = 'Please contact us at: support@datacamp.com'
match = re.search(r'(?P<email>(?P<username>[\w\.-]+)@(?P<host>[\w\.-]+))', statement)
if statement:
  print("Email address:", match.group('email'))
  print("Username:", match.group('username'))
  print("Host:", match.group('host'))
```
```
Email address: support@datacamp.com
Username: support
Host: datacamp.com
```
TIP: You can always access the named groups using numbers instead of the name. But as the number of groups increases, it gets harder to handle them using numbers alone. So, always make it a habit to use named groups instead.
  
### Greedy vs. Non-Greedy Matching
When a special character matches as much of the search sequence (string) as possible, it is said to be a "Greedy Match". It is the normal behavior of a regular expression, but sometimes this behavior is not desired:
```
pattern = "cookie"
sequence = "Cake and cookie"

heading  = r'<h1>TITLE</h1>'
re.match(r'<.*>', heading).group()
```
```
'<h1>TITLE</h1>'
```
The pattern <.*> matched the whole string, right up to the second occurrence of >. However, if you only wanted to match the first ```<h1>``` tag, you could have used the greedy qualifier *? that matches as little text as possible. Adding ? after the qualifier makes it perform the match in a non-greedy or minimal fashion; That is, as few characters as possible will be matched. When you run <.*>, you will only get a match with ```<h1>```
```
heading  = r'<h1>TITLE</h1>'
re.match(r'<.*?>', heading).group()
```
```
'<h1>'
```

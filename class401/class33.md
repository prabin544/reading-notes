### JSON Web Tokens

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens. Signed tokens can verify the integrity of the claims contained within it, while encrypted tokens hide those claims from other parties. When tokens are signed using public/private key pairs, the signature also certifies that only the party holding the private key is the one that signed it.

#### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
- Authorization
- Information Exchange

#### What is the JSON Web Token structure?
- Header

### How to Use JWT Authentication with Django REST Framework?

The JWT is just an authorization token that should be included in all requests:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/ -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTQzODI4NDMxLCJqdGkiOiI3ZjU5OTdiNzE1MGQ0NjU3OWRjMmI0OTE2NzA5N2U3YiIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9.Ju70kdcaHKn1Qaz8H42zrOYk0Jx9kIckTn9Xx7vhikY'
```
The JWT is acquired by exchanging an username + password for an access token and an refresh token.

The access token is usually short-lived (expires in 5 min or so, can be customized though).

The refresh token lives a little bit longer (expires in 24 hours, also customizable). It is comparable to an authentication session. After it expires, you need a full login with username + password again.

Why is that?

It’s a security feature and also it’s because the JWT holds a little bit more information. If you look closely the example I gave above, you will see the token is composed by three parts:
```
xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
```
Those are three distinctive parts that compose a JWT:
```
header.payload.signature
```
So we have here:
```
header = eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9
payload = eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTQzODI4NDMxLCJqdGkiOiI3ZjU5OTdiNzE1MGQ0NjU3OWRjMmI0OTE2NzA5N2U3YiIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9
signature = Ju70kdcaHKn1Qaz8H42zrOYk0Jx9kIckTn9Xx7vhikY
```
This information is encoded using Base64. If we decode, we will see something like this:

header
```
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "HS256"
}
```
payload
```
{
  "token_type": "access",
  "exp": 1543828431,
  "jti": "7f5997b7150d46579dc2b49167097e7b",
  "user_id": 1
}
```
signature

The signature is issued by the JWT backend, using the header base64 + payload base64 + SECRET_KEY. Upon each request this signature is verified. If any information in the header or in the payload was changed by the client it will invalidate the signature. The only way of checking and validating the signature is by using your application’s SECRET_KEY. Among other things, that’s why you should always keep your SECRET_KEY secret!

Installation & Setup
For this tutorial we are going to use the djangorestframework_simplejwt library, recommended by the DRF developers.
```
pip install djangorestframework_simplejwt
```
settings.py
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ],
}
```
urls.py
```
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework_simplejwt import views as jwt_views

urlpatterns = [
    # Your URLs...
    path('api/token/', jwt_views.TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
    path('api/token/refresh/', jwt_views.TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
]
```
Example Code
For this tutorial I will use the following route and API view:

views.py
```
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated


class HelloView(APIView):
    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)

    def get(self, request):
        content = {'message': 'Hello, World!'}
        return Response(content)
```
urls.py
```
from django.urls import path
from myapi.core import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('hello/', views.HelloView.as_view(), name='hello'),
]
```
Obtain Token
First step is to authenticate and obtain the token. The endpoint is /api/token/ and it only accepts POST requests.
```
http post http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/ username=vitor password=123
```


So basically your response body is the two tokens:
```
{
    "access": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTQ1MjI0MjU5LCJqdGkiOiIyYmQ1NjI3MmIzYjI0YjNmOGI1MjJlNThjMzdjMTdlMSIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9.D92tTuVi_YcNkJtiLGHtcn6tBcxLCBxz9FKD3qzhUg8",
    "refresh": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoicmVmcmVzaCIsImV4cCI6MTU0NTMxMDM1OSwianRpIjoiMjk2ZDc1ZDA3Nzc2NDE0ZjkxYjhiOTY4MzI4NGRmOTUiLCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.rA-mnGRg71NEW_ga0sJoaMODS5ABjE5HnxJDb0F8xAo"
}
```
After that you are going to store both the access token and the refresh token on the client side, usually in the localStorage.

In order to access the protected views on the backend (i.e., the API endpoints that require authentication), you should include the access token in the header of all requests, like this:
```
http http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/ "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTQ1MjI0MjAwLCJqdGkiOiJlMGQxZDY2MjE5ODc0ZTY3OWY0NjM0ZWU2NTQ2YTIwMCIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9.9eHat3CvRQYnb5EdcgYFzUyMobXzxlAVh_IAgqyvzCE"
```


You can use this access token for the next five minutes.

After five min, the token will expire, and if you try to access the view again, you are going to get the following error:
```
http http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello/ "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoiYWNjZXNzIiwiZXhwIjoxNTQ1MjI0MjAwLCJqdGkiOiJlMGQxZDY2MjE5ODc0ZTY3OWY0NjM0ZWU2NTQ2YTIwMCIsInVzZXJfaWQiOjF9.9eHat3CvRQYnb5EdcgYFzUyMobXzxlAVh_IAgqyvzCE"
```

Refresh Token
To get a new access token, you should use the refresh token endpoint /api/token/refresh/ posting the refresh token:
```
http post http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/refresh/ refresh=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ0b2tlbl90eXBlIjoicmVmcmVzaCIsImV4cCI6MTU0NTMwODIyMiwianRpIjoiNzAyOGFlNjc0ZTdjNDZlMDlmMzUwYjg3MjU1NGUxODQiLCJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxfQ.Md8AO3dDrQBvWYWeZsd_A1J39z6b6HEwWIUZ7ilOiPE
```

The return is a new access token that you should use in the subsequent requests.

The refresh token is valid for the next 24 hours. When it finally expires too, the user will need to perform a full authentication again using their username and password to get a new set of access token + refresh token.

#### What’s The Point of The Refresh Token?
At first glance the refresh token may look pointless, but in fact it is necessary to make sure the user still have the correct permissions. If your access token have a long expire time, it may take longer to update the information associated with the token. That’s because the authentication check is done by cryptographic means, instead of querying the database and verifying the data. So some information is sort of cached.

There is also a security aspect, in a sense that the refresh token only travel in the POST data. And the access token is sent via HTTP header, which may be logged along the way. So this also give a short window, should your access token be compromised.

### Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server
A Production Stack
You want to only use tech in production, which is reliable, well tested and has been around for a while.

A production setup usually consists of multiple components, each designed and built to be really good at one specific thing. They are fast, reliable and very focused.

When a request arrives at your server, it should be passed to a dedicated web server. Nginx is an example for a good web server.

This is an application, which is great at serving static files from disk (your css and js files for example) and handling multiple requests at once. If the request is not for a static file, but should be processed by your application, the webserver is configured to pass this request to the next component.

The next component is an application server. It gets those fancy requests and uses them to construct Python objects which are usable by Django. WSGI is a specification which people agreed on, which describe how that happens. Gunicorn is an example for a WSGI server.

### How Does Django Fit In?
Your Django app does not actually run as you would think a server would - waiting for requests and reacting to them. Your project provides a uwsgi.py file, which contains a function to be called by the application server. This function gets a Python object representing the incoming request.

This function calls your code, and produces a response object which is passed to the WSGI server. There the response is translated into a HTTP response and is passed back to the web server, which finally delivers it to the user.

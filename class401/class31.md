## Docker

Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.

Virtualization has its roots at the beginning of computer science when large, expensive mainframe computers were the norm. How could multiple programmers use the same single machine? The answer was virtualization and specifically virtual machines which are complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up.

## Install Docker
To install Docker we need to download the desktop app on our computer and create a free account [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

Hello, World
To confirm Docker installed correctly we can run our first command docker run hello-world. This will download an official image and then run the container. We’ll discuss both images and containers shortly.
```
$ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:9572f7cdcee8591948c2963463447a53466950b3fc15a247fcad1917ca215a2f
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

## Django REST Framework

```
(library) $ pipenv install djangorestframework~=3.11.0
```
```
# config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # 3rd party
    'rest_framework', # new

    # Local
    'books',
]
```
Let’s first create a new api app.
```
(library) $ python manage.py startapp api
```
```
# config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # 3rd party
    'rest_framework',

    # Local
    'books',
    'api', # new
]
```
#### URL
```
# config/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/', include('api.urls')), # new
    path('', include('books.urls')),
]
```
Then create a urls.py file within the api app.
```
(library) $ touch api/urls.py
```
And update it as follows:
```
# api/urls.py
from django.urls import path
from .views import BookAPIView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', BookAPIView.as_view()),
]
```
#### Views
```
# api/views.py
from rest_framework import generics

from books.models import Book
from .serializers import BookSerializer


class BookAPIView(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Book.objects.all()
    serializer_class = BookSerializer
```
Make a serializers.py file within our api app.
```
(library) $ touch api/serializers.py
```
Then update it as follows in a text editor.
```
# api/serializers.py
from rest_framework import serializers

from books.models import Book


class BookSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Book
        fields = ('title', 'subtitle', 'author', 'isbn')
```
#### Run server
```
library) $ python manage.py runserver
```

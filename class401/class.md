## Dunder Methods
Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). But an empty class definition doesn’t support this behavior out of the box:  
- Object Initialization: __init__
- Object Representation: __str__, __repr__
- Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__
- Operator Overloading: __eq__, __lt__, __add__
- Callable Python Objects: __call__
- Context Manager Support and the With Statement: __enter__, __exit__

## Statistics - Probability

#### What is probability?
At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur.
